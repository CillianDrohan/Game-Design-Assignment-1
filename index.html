  <h4>NARRATIVE SYNOPSIS</h4>
  <p>The story begins with Alice waking up in the attic of her house, not remembering how she got there. She sees a decorative wooden box. The box rumbles occasionally and she can hear a myriad of whispers from inside. She takes the box with her and heads downstairs but before she leaves, she sees her own cold, dead corpse. </p>
  <p>An evil spirit by the name of Elvira appears and tells Alice about her being the cause of Alice’s families’ deaths and trapping their souls in the wooden box Alice is holding. She taunts Alice with the key that will open the box. She tosses the key to the box down a hole in the floor and tells Alice she can have it… if she can find it. Elvira screams in a demonic voice, “YOU WILL NEVER SEE YOUR FAMILY AGAIN!”. Elvira disappears cackling all the while. Alice is terrified and crying but continues to make her way through her house, determined to find the key.</p>
  <p>Alice, scared and alone, tries to make her way downstairs. The box shakes violently and releases a screaming spirit that breaks the ceiling above the stairs, blocking Alice’s path, forcing Alice to find a different path. Another spirit slips out of the box and guides Alice to an exit before quietly returning to the box. </p>
  <p>Another spirit gently slides out of the box and guides Alice. She feels safer with the spirit nearby. She finds the mangled corpses belonging to her family strewn about. When passing by the stair to the first floor, the box begins to shake violently and a spirit erupts from the box and attack the spirit guiding Alice. Both spirits claw at each other before being sucked into the box. Alice loses control of the box and it falls into the dark downstairs.</p>
  <p>When Alice makes her way down, nervously, to retrieve her box. The attacking spirit flies up the stairs through Alice and shouts “Stay!”. Alice shivers. The comfort Alice feels from having the box and the spirit near her is now gone. Any confidence that Alice had is gone and replaced with fear. While making her way through the first floor Elvira is waiting to scare Alice and takes joy in doing so. Elvira taunts Alice for being stuck and disappears. Alice finds the box in a dark corner.</p>
  <p>Alice now in the living room, looks around to find the key Elvira threw in the hole. Once finding the hole in the roof, Alice combs through the living room trying to find the key. She finds the key after a while and rushes to unlock the box. It doesn’t work. She tries continuously but nothing happens. Elvira laughs behind Alice fiddling with a key in her hand. The doors to the living room slam shut.</p>
  <p>Elvira laughs maniacally all the while exclaiming how it was fun playing with her. Elvira snaps her fingers and Alice is trapped; her body becomes sewn to the ground. Elvira picks up the box next to Alice and exclaims “you’ll meet your family soon” all while patting the box. Elvira then tells Alice what happened to her family, and how she lured them here the same way Alice was, so that spirit capture ritual could be performed inside the magic circle in the living room. “I’m going to consume the souls so I can be born again”.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, the box shakes violently and the spirit the broke the ceiling and the attacking spirit erupt from the box and attack Elvira. “Run!” the spirits say. While Elvira is distracted Alice becomes able to move again. The guiding spirit comes out of the box and attacks the other two spirits. Alice didn’t realise straight away but could now see the spirits attacking Elvira were her parents. Alice, despite the fear lunges at Elvira trying to grab at the key. Alice snatches the key and takes the box that Elvira dropped and unlocks it. Elvira lets out a scream before the box erupted in white light. </p>
  <p>Alice is knocked back by the forced of thousands of souls escaping. Alice is in a daze but suddenly she can hear her father clearly saying “lock the box!”. Before Alice had time to answer Elvira, her parents and the guiding spirit catapult into the box. Alice closes the box and locks it, muffling the screeches from Elvira and the guiding spirit. </p>
  <p>Alice bursts into tears and hugs the box with is now quiet, no shaking and no whispers. Alice notices her hands start to glow gold. She can feel something pull her upwards. In a flash of light, the Alice disappears leaving the box behind, with the key still in the hole. </p>
  
  <h4>CHARACTER PROFILE</h4>
  <p><b>ALICE:</b> Alice is the protagonist and playable character. She is a scared young girl that was killed by the evil spirit Elvira. Alice is an innocent young girl who while alive had blonde had and wore a white sundress. As a spirit she has a white glow to her opposed to Elvira’s grey to highlight her innocent and unstained soul. </p>
  <p>Alice is fearful of Elvira and Elvira’s twisted version of her house, as she makes her way through the house, she gains courage, eventually having enough courage to confront Elvira. Alice desperately wants her family (Mother, Father and brother) back, and is determined to do this at any means necessary. Elvira tells Alice how she can get her family back and Alice blindly and naively trusts this information which eventually turns out to be a trick.</p>
  <p>Alice needs her family and is lost without them, which is why she holds onto Elvira’s Box so tightly, as some form of comfort. She is convinced that she can get her family back, and can go back to living as normal. When she learns this is not possible her attention turns to stopping Elvira. Alice is fuelled by a desire to avenge her family and stop Elvira harvesting souls and end Elvira’s evil doings. </p>
  <p><b>ELVIRA:</b> Elvira is the antagonist of this story. She is an evil old hag that was cursed to wander the world in perpetuity and to never rest. Elvira was cursed by a “supreme being” for her sins against humanity, and has lived and immortal and unseen life for thousands of years but eventually learned how to interact with her environment as a poltergeist. She also learned that the consumption of souls could return her to a physical form for a time. She intends to consume a massive amount of souls to live for almost an eternity in the mortal realm.</p>
  <p>Elvira’s is trapping souls in her box until she has enough for her “reincarnation”. Elvira is shrouded in black, grey and dusty brown colours to represent her stained life and malevolence. Her goal is revival and she is collecting souls to do so. She wants revenge on the supreme being that cursed her and she sees her resurrection as payback and a spit in their face as she’s avoiding punishment.</p>
  <p>Elvira has grown to like to “play with her food”, which is why she let’s Alice have the box and trick Alice and toys with her emotions. Her cruelty and carelessness prove her undoing as this gives Alice the opportunity to thwart her plan and end her scheme. </p>
